A work in progress to update and generalise the software used to produce some of the numerical results in [1]. 
In particular, time evolving the collision of a soliton in the sine-Gordon model with a typically non-integrable Robin boundary 
and determining the solitons in the reflected field by computing part of the scattering data associated with the inverse scattering method.
 
 ### Installation
 [Download](https://github.com/rparini/solitonscattering/archive/master.zip), unzip and navigate to the folder `solitonscattering-master`.
 From there install from the command line with:
 ```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 python install setup.py
 ```
